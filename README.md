# pybind11_catkin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ipab-slmc/pybind11_catkin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ipab-slmc/pybind11_catkin)

This repository wraps the bleeding edge versions of [``pybind11``](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/) for use in catkin-based projects. Please note that for ROS Melodic (Ubuntu Bionic), an official ``pybind11-dev`` package exists, albeit an older, fixed/stable version.
